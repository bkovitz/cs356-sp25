\begin{abstract}
Case study of a Software Design course taught using mob programming. Mob
programming (also ``team programming'', ``ensemble programming'') is
collaborative programming in which the whole team---in this case, the
whole class---writes code together at the same time, like pair programming
but including everyone.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
I taught a course on software design in the Spring~2025 semester at
California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (course number CS~356),
predominantly by a new pedagogy: mob programming. Mob programming,
also called team programming or ensemble programming, is ``a software
development approach where the whole team works together on the same thing,
in the same space, and at the same computer.''\cite{zuill2022software}
Mob programming is like pair programming, but not limited to two programmers
at one computer.

Several reasons suggested mob programming as an effective way to teach
software design:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Experience from industry suggests that pair programming and mob
  programming result in knowledge spreading rapidly throughout the team.
  %@@CITE
  So, why not exploit this happy property of mob programming as a class's
  principal method of learning?

  \item Many industry complaints about skills lacking in recent college
  graduates revolve around ``habitability''---the aspects of design that
  go beyond correctness and relate to programmers' ability to work with
  code over many years, such as readability, maintainability, testability,
  and debuggability.\cite{Gabriel1996}. The usual college-course format
  of lectures, homework assignments, and exams often gives students
  experience only with writing small, stand-alone pieces of code that just
  barely work or partly work (enough to get partial credit) and that no one
  looks at again. Could mob programming on one project, building it for most
  of one semester by piecemeal growth, give students valuable experience
  working on each other's code, seeing for themselves how to grow a software
  design and how to make the codebase habitable for others?

  \item Software engineering is a complex and collaborative art,
  involving constant learning and constant adjustment to unexpected problems
  and to other people on the development team. Much of the skill is difficult
  or impossible to express precisely in verbal representations and procedures,
  and can be acquired only through practice. This makes it a good fit for the
  research by anthropologists Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger on learning in
  ``communities of practice''.\cite{wenger2015introduction}
  Could mob programming create an artificial community of practice for one
  semester?

  \item Only seven students were enrolled in the class. CS~356 is a
  junior-level course, and these students are among the first cohorts in the
  university's recently begun Software Engineering degree program. So,
  this semester provided a good opportunity to experiment with mob
  programming.
\end{enumerate}

The rest of this article describes how the course went: its structure,
problems that arose and solutions that we found or didn't find, and a final
assessment.



\begin{comment}
Semester overview (put this in a small table).

Link to the complete syllabus.

``Software design'' is a highly ambiguous term. 

In an ordinary class, I would have demo'ed how to implement the finite state
machine, projecting my computer's screen to the whole class. Instead, we did
our first mob programming.

The day I improvised a lecture on agile vs. waterfall. Previous exposure had
given some students the impression that agile is hopelessly high-risk
because it has no discipline and other
students the impression that waterfall is hopelessly high-risk because it's
inflexible and assumes perfect forethought.

Some students had previous experience with Git and some did not.

No textbooks.

Hard to teach, easy to teach.

Problems: Not enough mobbing hours in the semester. A true community of
practice would meet nearly every day.

\section{Body of the Manuscript}
The text may be organized into sections and subsections. Please use
\verb+\section+ and  \verb+\subsection+ commands to define them as shown in the
Latex source file of this document. Latex will apply section formatting rules.

\subsection{Abstract}
Provide a one-paragraph brief overview of the paper in both the manuscript for
review and in the final manuscript for publication.

%\subsection{Citation}
%Appropriately cite all references to other published works included in the paper.
%\texttt{biblatex} is used to create a list of references or bibliography as the
%last section in the paper. Here are citation examples for a
%book\cite{latexcompanion}, a journal paper\cite{einstein}, a
%website\cite{knuthwebsite}, and a conference proceeding paper\cite{maurer}.
%Please check out the source code of this document for details.

\subsection{Double Quote}
The proper way to typeset double quote is to use two backticks or grave accents
(\`{}) on the left and two single quotes (\'{}) on the right, e.g.
\`{}\`{}Hello!\'{}\'{} for ``Hello!''.

\subsection{Lists}
Lists are easy to create in  \LaTeX\ whether they are ordered, unordered, or
nested as shown in the following example.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item The individual entries are indicated with a black dot, a so-called bullet.
  \item The text in the entries may be of any length.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item The labels consist of sequential numbers.
  \item The numbers start at 1 with every call to the enumerate environment.
\end{enumerate}

   \end{itemize}
   \item The numbers start at 1 with every call to the enumerate environment.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Math Expressions}
The mass-energy equivalence is described by the famous equation

$$E=mc^2$$

discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.
In natural units ($c$ = 1), the formula expresses the identity

\begin{equation}
E=m
\end{equation}

\subsection{Tables and Figures}
Include all tables and figures within the body of the text. (Provide as separate
files in the original format any figures so that if there are problems with the
figures coming into the final manuscript there are alternatives available to the editors.)

Here is an example Table \ref{table:nonlin}. Note that each table or figure \textbf{must} have
a title as our style requirement.

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Nonlinear Model Results} % title of Table
\label{table:nonlin} % is used to refer this table in the text
\centering % used for centering table
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} % centered columns (4 columns)
\hline\hline %inserts double horizontal lines
Case & Method\#1 & Method\#2 & Method\#3 \\ [0.5ex] % inserts table
%heading
\hline % inserts single horizontal line
1 & 50 & 837 & 970 \\ % inserting body of the table
2 & 47 & 877 & 230 \\
3 & 31 & 25 & 415 \\
4 & 35 & 144 & 2356 \\
5 & 45 & 300 & 556 \\ [1ex] % [1ex] adds vertical space
\hline %inserts single line
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The trim size of the journal is half-letter size, so please be aware that your
tables or figures may be hard to read if the fonts are too small as shown in
this Figure \ref{figure:big_table}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{big_table.png}
\caption{Fonts are too small.}
\label{figure:big_table}
\end{figure}

In this case, you can either divide the table into multiple parts, or put the
table/figure sideways on its own page as shown in Figure \ref{figure:big_table1}.
\begin{sidewaysfigure}[htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{big_table.png}
  \caption{A big table turned sideways on its own page.}
  \label{figure:big_table1}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

The code for inserting figures sideways is as follows:

\vbox{
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX, basicstyle=\footnotesize,
caption=Code to Insert Figures Sideways]
\begin{sidewaysfigure}[htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{big_table.png}
  \caption{A big table turned sideways on its own page.}
  \label{figure:big_table1}
\end{sidewaysfigure}
\end{lstlisting}
}
Here is a live example: \url{https://www.overleaf.com/read/fzcmnctdppgz}

\subsection{Use of Color}
Even though our digital journal is in color, our print journal is in black and white.
You may choose to use other colors in your paper, but please be aware that the colors
you choose may not be distinguishable after they are turned into gray-scale.

\subsection{Reference List}
The \verb+\printbibliography+ command prints a list of references for you.
Please use \texttt{sample.bib} as an example to create your bibliography entries.

If you can find a reference on \url{https://scholar.google.com/} you can get a
``BibTex'' export by clicking on the quotation mark symbol, which is a lot easier
than entering the information manually.

\subsection{Code Listings}
Commands from \texttt{listings} package allow you to display code easily with
customizable coloring and styling rules. Here is an example.
Please check out the source code of this document for details.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,  caption=Python example]
x = 42
epsilon = 0.01
step = epsilon**2
num_guesses = 0
ans = 0.0
while abs(ans**2-x) > epsilon and ans < x:
    ans = ans + step
    num_guesses += 1
if abs(ans**2-x) <= epsilon:
    print(str(ans) +
    ' is close to the square root of ' +
    str(x))
else:
    print('Failed to find square root of ' + str(x))
print("The number of guesses is " + str(num_guesses))
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Manuscript Submission}
The following materials will need to be submitted:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item The final manuscript in Latex.
  \item Copyright release. It is essential that we receive the copyright
  release form. By signing this form you are acknowledging that the manuscript
  has not been printed in another venue, plus you are retaining your rights for
  use of the manuscript. Read the copyright release. The Consortium will not
  prohibit you from using the manuscript, but will ask that you credit any reuse
  to the Consortium as the original source of publication. If you misplace the
  copyright form, a generic copyright form can be found through the Copyright
  Release Form\cite{copyright}.\\
  The Consortium encourages multiple presentations of tutorials and workshops.
  If you are presenting a tutorial or workshop you may retain the copyright,
  but we must have that documented. Keep in mind that your manuscript is limited
  to two pages total. However, you must still submit a copyright form.\\
  Please note that it is critical that you obtain permission to use third party
  material. If you use diagrams and such that are attributable to a third party
  you must obtain formal permission to reprint such items, and must so indicate
  in the copyright release as well as submit such permission.
  \item Registration for the conference, along with the appropriate registration
  fee. We have found that there are some folks in need of publication for
  promotion and tenure purposes, and then don’t want to present the paper.
  A major plus of the Consortium conferences is the presentation of the papers,
  and you must plan on attending. If you do not present the paper at the
  conference the paper will be removed from the ACM Digital Library.
  \item A pdf version of your manuscript is most helpful. If there are problems
  with special characters or special formatting this provides the editors with
  what you expected your final manuscript to look like. Providing a pdf version
  or a hard copy helps significantly in envisioning what the author expected
  the final product to look like.
  \item Electronic copies of any graphics in a standard format (bitmap, jpeg, tiff).
\end{enumerate}
